        <p>My name is Ayda, and I am a Ph.D. student in planning, governance, and globalization (PGG) program at VT. I received bachelor's degree in urban and regional planning and master's degree in urban design, both from the University of Tehran, Iran. My research mainly lies in the field of environmental planning. I am interested in testing the physical and social vulnerabilities of urban environments toward the risk of climate-related hazards such as extreme heat events.

        My favorite hobbies are baking, swimming, and yoga. I also think that I am very good at making homemade pizzas, but I don’t know why the facial expression of those who have tried tells an opposite story :)

        <p>My name is Lechuan, I’m a Senior majoring in Smart and Sustainable Cities with a minor in Landscape Architecture. I was born and raised in Zhejiang, China before coming to Virginia Tech. I’m interested in sustainable development and hoping to learn more about it through my current undergraduate and incoming graduate studies.

        Currently I’m helping Theo with research on Green Infrastructure (GI). We mainly focus on how experts in academic and professional fields with different expertise are working together to adopt interdisciplinary studies on GI in order to provide comprehensive solutions to stormwater management.

        Traveling is my favorite thing to do when I am off. But I’m the kind of guy who starts to enjoy the fun of traveling the moment I step out of my home: I like riding public transportation so I am actually more enthusiastic about being “en route” rather than simply “visiting.”
