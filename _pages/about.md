Welcome! I am an assistant professor of Urban Affairs and Planning in the School of Public and International Affairs at Virginia Tech. My research focuses on decision-making around the linkages between land, water, infrastructure, and people. I currently have projects in two major areas:

1. Climate adaptation in cities, and building community resilience to the effects of climate change. This work is supported by NSF and NOAA grants, in which we use community-engaged approaches, especially working with youth and families, to build physical and social infrastructures necessary for communities facing challenges of a changing climate.

2. How data and models are used within environmental management and planning contexts. In 2023, I was awarded an [NSF CAREER grant](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2238552&HistoricalAwards=false) to explore the development of computer models of the environment as a socio-political process. I will be looking at international case studies of environmental management in which computer models are used to guide decision-making and as "boundary objects" to facilitate communication between diverse knowledges and stakeholders. Better understanding of these processes will help reduce considerable institutional uncertainty around how computer models are developed and used in our most consequential socio-environmental decisions.

I am interested in studying these topics to help communities become more sustainable given limited natural resources and more resilient in the face of social and environmental change. In my work, I center the importance of inclusive and representative decision-making processes. At Virginia Tech, I teach classes related to sustainable urban infrastructure, smart cities, environmental policy/planning, and urban analytics.

In addition to my academic research and teaching, I have also worked in the following roles:

- Environmental data scientist in the agricultural technology industry
- Civil engineer focused on sustainable water infrastructure planning and design
- Public health and urbanization researcher as a Fulbright Scholar in Northeast China

I use both quantitative and qualitative methods in my research, including: statistical analysis and machine/deep learning, environmental simulation, focus groups/interviews, content/document analysis, and participant observation. I received my PhD in City and Regional Planning from the University of Pennsylvania, MS in Environmental Science and Engineering from Tsinghua University, and my BA from Swarthmore College.

I am also currently one of two co-chairs of the [Asian Pacific Islander Desi American (APIDA) Caucus](https://blogs.tlos.vt.edu/aaac/) for faculty, staff, students, and community members at Virginia Tech.
