Welcome! I am an assistant professor of Urban Affairs and Planning in the School of Public and International Affairs at Virginia Tech. My research focuses on green infrastructure planning and decision-making around the linkages between land, water, infrastructure, and people. I also research how data and models are used within environmental management and planning contexts. I am interested in studying these topics to help communities become more sustainable given limited natural resources and more resilient in the face of social and environmental change. At Virginia Tech, I teach classes related to sustainable urban infrastructure, smart cities, environmental policy/planning, and urban analytics.

In addition to my academic research and teaching, I have also worked in the following roles:

- Environmental data scientist in the agricultural technology industry
- Civil engineer focused on sustainable water infrastructure planning and design
- Public health and urbanization researcher as a Fulbright Scholar in Northeast China

I use both quantitative and qualitative methods in my research, including: statistical analysis and machine/deep learning, environmental simulation, focus groups/interviews, and content/document analysis. I received my PhD in City and Regional Planning from the University of Pennsylvania, MS in Environmental Science and Engineering from Tsinghua University, and my BA from Swarthmore College.

I am also currently one of two co-chairs of the [Asian Pacific Islander Desi American (APIDA) Caucus](https://blogs.tlos.vt.edu/aaac/) for faculty, staff, students, and community members at Virginia Tech.
