Welcome! I am an assistant professor in Urban Affairs and Planning. My research focuses on green infrastructure planning, urban hydrology, water resource planning, and the linkages between land, water, infrastructure, and people. I am interested in studying these topics to help communities become more sustainable given limited natural resources and more resilient in the face of social and environmental change. At Virginia Tech, I teach classes related to sustainable urban infrastructure, smart cities, environmental policy/planning, and urban analytics.

In addition to my academic research and teaching, I have also worked in the following roles:

- Environmental data scientist in the agricultural technology industry
- Civil engineer focused on sustainable water infrastructure planning and design
- Public health and urbanization as a Fulbright Scholar in Northeast China

I use both quantitative and qualitative methods in my research, including: statistical analysis and machine/deep learning, environmental simulation, focus groups/interviews, and content/document analysis. I received my PhD in City and Regional Planning from the University of Pennsylvania, MS in Environmental Science and Engineering from Tsinghua University, and my BA from Swarthmore College.

I am also currently one of three co-chairs of the VT Asian Pacific Islander Desi American (APIDA) Caucus for faculty, staff, students, and community members.
