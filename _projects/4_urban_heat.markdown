Exposure to extreme heat in US cities causes hundreds of fatalities each year. Temperatures in cities is highly related to physical conditions that shape urban microclimates, such as: building massing, amount of impervious surfaces (such as concrete and asphalt), landscaping/tree cover, and material types. Social factors, such as age, race, income level, availability of access to air conditioning, and weatherization of housing stock increase the inequity of vulnerability that urban residents have to extreme heat events. We are currently working with the City of Roanoke to define an "extreme heat resilience infrastructure" within vulnerable neighborhoods to address these needs.
