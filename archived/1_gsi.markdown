Stormwater runoff is the water that washes of hard surfaces in cities and towns --buildings, streets, sidewalks. Runoff can result in both property damage (through flooding), and in environmental degradation (through washing pollution into natural waterways and changes in the hydrological cycle). "Green infrastructure" refers to the the use of vegetation and native soils, in addition to conventional pipes and pumps for managing stormwater runoff. Many cities around the world now have green infrastructure plans, which include building best management practices, such as rain gardens, bioswales, and permeable pavement. But, significant challenges still exist in scaling up this kind of infrastructure. I am particularly interested in spatial planning of green infrastructure in cities and how to evaluate city-scale "success" of green infrastructure implementation.
