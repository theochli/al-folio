I have received seed funding from the Virginia Tech +Policy Fellows program to study community-scale bioenergy + carbon capture and storage (BECCS) technologies.

BECCS is one of a handful of negative emissions technologies being considered to permanently remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and keep global warming temperatures within the 1.5 degree Celsius warming target recommended by the IPCC. However, most research that evaluate potential benefits against negative impacts of widespread use of BECCS have been carried out at global scales. In my research, I am looking specifically at how energy infrastructure and land management practices at local scales may be coordinated through local decision-making and planning processes to achieve net negative emissions.
