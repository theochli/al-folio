This week, two papers from the lab were published online. The first, titled ["Technoeconomic Analysis of Negative Emissions Bioenergy with Carbon Capture and Storage through Pyrolysis and Bioenergy District Heating Infrastructure"](https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.1c03478) (in *Environmental Science & Technology*), was a collaboration with co-authors Amanda Cuellar, [Kyle Langseth](http://www.langseth.us/), and [Jeff Waldon](https://restorationbio.com/). This research is the first lifecycle analysis (costs and GHG emissions) to look at the use of biochar and locally sourced switchgrass, coupled with a district heating facility to reach net negative emissions. This is also known as carbon dioxide removal. Demonstrating that this is feasible at local scales presents an alternative to large, centralized infrastructure, and shifts decision-making to local actors.

The second paper that was published online this week is titled ["Comparison of machine learning algorithms for emulation of a gridded hydrological model given spatially explicit inputs"](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cageo.2021.105025), and was a collaboration with a former PhD student, Kaidi Wang (now an assistant professor at Macau University of Science and Technology).
