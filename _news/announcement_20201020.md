The [GO Virginia Developing a Desintation for Talent Program](https://www.provost.vt.edu/executive-vice-provost/develop-destination-talent.html) seeks to provide opportunities for VT students to connect with regional employers. This grant will train students to operate unmanned aerial vehicles (drones) for applications in urban planning, infrastructure inspection/maintenance, and real estate.

***

With the grant, Dr. Lim's lab will purchase a [DJI Mavic 2 Enterprise Dual](https://www.dji.com/mavic-2-enterprise-advanced) drone, which is outfitted with two cameras, one that captures the visible light spectrum, and one that captures thermal infrared data. The latter allows for estimates of land surface temperatures that can be used in extreme heat planning (mitigation of urban heat island effect). Students of Dr. Lim's *Urban Infrastructure* class will build on heat data collection efforts already underway at the City of Roanoke, supplementing existing data sets with high resolution drone-imagery. They will also learn to operate the drone safely in urban environments, develop protocols for preflight planning, emergency/hazard mitigation for each site, and gain confidence in operating drones in complex environments. Drone operation is a [rapidly growing industry](https://www.govtech.com/budget-finance/Drone-Related-Job-Growth-to-Outpace-Predictions.html) and students will gain invaluable experience that will help them on the job market.
