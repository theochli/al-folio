Dr Lim is leading an interdisciplinary team of natural and social scientists and community partners to address the issue of extreme heat in Roanoke, VA. The project, titled "Youth-centered civic technology and citizen science for improving community heat resilience infrastructure", centers the role that youth programs can play in building community connections. The team will train youth to implement, citizen science methods including: wearable and fixed-location sensors, participatory GIS, intercept surveys, and photovoice. The data collected will be used in an online digital heat resilience hub, the creation of which will (1) build social connection and awareness around the issue of heat that are necessary preconditions for community resilience; and (2) increase the inclusivity and comprehensiveness of long-term planning and policy processes for mitigating and managing the effects of extreme heat in the city.

The Civic Innovation program of NSF is unique because it emphasizes civic partner-identified research needs. This is meant to accelerate the process of connecting the production of science with improved societal outcomes.

Below is the conceptual diagram summarizing our proposal, which aims to integrate the strengthening of three types of infrastructure for making communities more resilient to the effects of extreme heat: physical, social, and digital.
