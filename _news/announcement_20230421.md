Jack Carroll, a graduating senior majoring in Environmental Planning and Policy, presented his research on spatial biases of ChatGPT. Jack tested ChatGPT's capacity to "predict" distances between pairs of McDonald's locations throughout the Commonwealth of Virginia and found some interesting patterns: ChatGPT performed the best when both McDonald's locations were in urban areas, and worst when one location was urban and one was rural. We look forward to expanding this work in the future!

Nice work, Jack!
